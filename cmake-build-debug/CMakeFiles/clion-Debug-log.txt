CMake Deprecation Warning at arrangements/external/oneTBB/CMakeLists.txt:15 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 3.5 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
  CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.

CINOLIB OPTIONAL MODULES: OpenGL, GLFW, ImGui
CMake Warning (dev) at /snap/clion/332/bin/cmake/linux/x64/share/cmake-3.30/Modules/FindOpenGL.cmake:415 (message):
  Policy CMP0072 is not set: FindOpenGL prefers GLVND by default when
  available.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0072" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  FindOpenGL found both a legacy GL library:

    OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGL.so

  and GLVND libraries for OpenGL and GLX:

    OPENGL_opengl_LIBRARY: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libOpenGL.so
    OPENGL_glx_LIBRARY: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGLX.so

  OpenGL_GL_PREFERENCE has not been set to "GLVND" or "LEGACY", so for
  compatibility with CMake 3.10 and below the legacy GL library will be used.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  arrangements/external/Cinolib/cinolib-config.cmake:40 (find_package)
  CMakeLists.txt:59 (find_package)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
