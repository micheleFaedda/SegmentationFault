CMake Deprecation Warning at arrangements/external/oneTBB/CMakeLists.txt:15 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 3.5 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
  CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.


CMake Warning at arrangements/external/oneTBB/CMakeLists.txt:116 (message):
  You are building oneTBB as a static library.  This is highly discouraged
  and such configuration is not supported.  Consider building a dynamic
  library to avoid unforeseen issues.

CINOLIB OPTIONAL MODULES: OpenGL, GLFW, ImGui
CMake Warning (dev) at /snap/clion/332/bin/cmake/linux/x64/share/cmake-3.30/Modules/FindOpenGL.cmake:415 (message):
  Policy CMP0072 is not set: FindOpenGL prefers GLVND by default when
  available.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0072" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  FindOpenGL found both a legacy GL library:

    OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGL.so

  and GLVND libraries for OpenGL and GLX:

    OPENGL_opengl_LIBRARY: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libOpenGL.so
    OPENGL_glx_LIBRARY: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGLX.so

  OpenGL_GL_PREFERENCE has not been set to "GLVND" or "LEGACY", so for
  compatibility with CMake 3.10 and below the legacy GL library will be used.

This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
